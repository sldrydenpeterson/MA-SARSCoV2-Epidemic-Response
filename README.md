# MA-SARSCoV2-Epidemic-Response

This repository includes only publicly released data over the course of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Massachusetts by the Department of Public Heath (MDPH), the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC), MassGIS, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Variant frequency estimates are generated from sequences posted to the GISAID by MDPH, Broad Institute, CDC, and other agencies/laboratories and analyzed under the GISAID terms of use.

The data has been collected, curated, and stored with care, but errors, omissions, may exist. In addition, at the time of initial release public health authorities often do not have complete information and data is corrected/completed over time. If these updates are not part of subsequent data releases, they would not be captured in this respository. Users are encouraged to seek access to primary datasets held by their owners.
